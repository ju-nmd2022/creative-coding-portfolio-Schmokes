    "description": "I was inspired by Herbert W. Franke and his random Squares. The natrual chaos of different squares made it possible to dig deeper into what is possible with a simple shape. Just starting with simple steps and adding more and more features to the art."

    "name": "Random Squares v2",
    "description": "These squares are a modified version of the first version of the Random Squares by Gerbert W. Franke. The main different now is that random squares have a decreased opacity than others. This creates more depth into the art."

    "description": "So far the artwork had been quite boring with just black and white. With a pop of color and a decreased opacity, this reminds me of colored glass windows. I implemented a random function for the color pop and opacity."

    "description": "The falling circles are a variation of the increasing circles. This shows the difference the movement has on our perception. To create the falling effect I rotated the square."

    "description": "To create more active movement in this artwork, I decided to add a noise. I kept the position of the big square at the same place, as I liked the inital start and keeping a few aspects of the original drawing by Vera Molnar."
